        <h1>Cloning Myself</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on August 4, 2025</p>

        <p>My friend sent me an album by Possible Humans called Everybody Split this morning and I had been giving it a listen. It's quite good and feels very 90s. I have also been thinking about the question I had last time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine-tuning and choosing the right model to begin with. Is it even possible to tune a model to the creator's voice? What personality traits and 'memories' from the creator should be included?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was able to both get a download of my iMessage data (in .txt) and also my Instagram/Facebook conversation data in .json. It turned out to be over 3.5gbs and 270,000 back and forths. I believe this is certainly enough data to make a &quot;me-LoRA&quot;. There are a few big questions that I must answer first:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>There is a lot of sensitive information</em> - could I use something like a <a href="https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER">GliNER</a> to quickly go through the entire .txt iMessage file?</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems pretty easy in that I can just first import:</p>
<pre><code>from gliner import GLiNER

model = GLiNER.from_pretrained(&quot;urchade/gliner_base&quot;) 
</code></pre>
<p>and after cleaning the data, something like:</p>
<pre><code>entities = model.predict_entities(stripped_line, entity_labels)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>The NER should be able to remove any PII, but <em>what about the conversation content itself?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>There is going to be some things I say to some friends that I don't want other friends to know. Maybe my clone will need to be conversation specific since my relationships are truly 1:1. This will have implications for Tease as well, as conversations without any context should have a default personality. The default personality has to be created somehow. I'm thinking there are layers to this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Level 1: Strangers</strong> - Our personality is a bit different when we are talking with strangers</li>
<li><strong>Level 2: Acquaintances</strong> - This are the people we don't really share that much about ourselves yet but this can also quickly evolve into friendships. We don't shittalk people with acquaintances.</li>
<li><strong>Level 3: Friends</strong> - These are the people we can really trust. This is where it becomes 1:1, because we would tell certain friends things and shittalk could be here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, this was rambling, but hopefully I can make these three versions of myself by the next update. I wonder if I can even host it for everyone to give it a try.</p>
