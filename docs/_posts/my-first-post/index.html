        <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on July 28, 2025</p>

        <p>This is my very first post on my new blog! Welcome. I'll be writing random thoughts and stuff to this blog as I'm building things, listening to music I really like, or feeling thoughtful.</p>
<p>Currently I am working on Tease and seeing how far I can take the company. I actually think I'm going to learn ComfyUI and build a consistent AI Instagram model and experience the problems of DMs myself. I also plan to do some extensive outreach to see how the market reacts to the current landing page. There are two hard challenges, I'll need to experiment with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving the creator's DMs from walled-gardens like OF, Instagram, Fansly, and others.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning and choosing the right model to begin with. Is it even possible to tune a model to the creator's voice? What personality traits and 'memories' from the creator should be included?</li>
<li>What does the fan side of the look like? Do they need to log in? Are the unique conversations 'remembered' by the model? If so, how do I do that?</li>
<li>Figuring out the monetization and unit economics for this. Do I limit the number of messages a fan can send and then paywall? Do I keep it open, but block content that the fan would need to pay for? Maybe both. TBD here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, I anticipate many challenges and looking forward to sharing the journey with everyone.</p>
