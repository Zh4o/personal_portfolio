This is my very first post on my new blog! Welcome. I'll be writing random thoughts and stuff to this blog as I'm building things, listening to music I really like, or feeling thoughtful. 

Currently I am working on Tease and seeing how far I can take the company. I actually think I'm going to learn ComfyUI and build a consistent AI Instagram model and experience the problems of DMs myself. I also plan to do some extensive outreach to see how the market reacts to the current landing page. There are two hard challenges, I'll need to experiment with:
1. Saving the creator's DMs from walled-gardens like OF, Instagram, Fansly, and others.
2. Fine-tuning and choosing the right model to begin with. Is it even possible to tune a model to the creator's voice? What personality traits and 'memories' from the creator should be included?
3. What does the fan side of the look like? Do they need to log in? Are the unique conversations 'remembered' by the model? If so, how do I do that?
4. Figuring out the monetization and unit economics for this. Do I limit the number of messages a fan can send and then paywall? Do I keep it open, but block content that the fan would need to pay for? Maybe both. TBD here.

Anyways, I anticipate many challenges and looking forward to sharing the journey with everyone.
